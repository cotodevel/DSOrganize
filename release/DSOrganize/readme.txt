This readme file is not meant to be an all-inclusive instructional manual on using DSOrganize.  It is meant to be an introduction to the featureset and some of what you can do with it.  To get more information, visit http://wiki.dragonminded.com/ and read up.

1.0 Introduction
----------------
DSOrganize is meant as a homebrew organizer application for the Nintendo DS that should have come built in in the first place. It is by no means comparible to a full-fledged organizer such as a palm, and it is not planned to become an operating system, video player, or anything similar. Many thanks go out to several dedicated members in the homebrew community for their help and libraries, without which, DSOrganize would not exist.

1.1 Included Files
------------------
DSOrganize directory - Mandatory for successful installation.  Please place either on the root of the card or under /data/

2.0 Getting Started
-------------------
	To run DSOrganize, make sure you have unzipped or moved the entire contents (sans this readme) to your CF/SD/microSD card.  There are several support files including help and resource files that need to be present for all of the features to work properly.  To boot DSOrganize, either set it as your shell (possible under GBAMP, DS-X or ninjaDS) or launch it from your card's menu.  To get help on any specific feature, hold select on the screen and help will be displayed.  The recommended card solution for use with DSOrganize is the GBAMP, although this might not be practical in your situation.  In that case, the CycloDS Evo card might be better.  If you absolutely must try DSOrganize right now, you can run to your local Best Buy and grab a Games 'n' Music.  I do not have many other cards to test on so I can't recommend others.  Compatibility depends on availability of drivers and their completeness.
