<p>To edit text, simply enter characters on the virtual keyboard as you would on a normal keyboard.  Use the d-pad to move the cursor around.  The <i>spl</i> button switches keyboards to special character entry mode.  This is useful for foreign langauges and for making funny faces in your text such as ò_ó or Ö_ö.</p>
