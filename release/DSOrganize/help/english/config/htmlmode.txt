This setting allows you to change the rendering mechanism in DSOrganize.  If text only is selected, DSOrganize will render just the text portion of the site, in one size font.  If extended is selected, DSOrganize attempts to read different heading tags and size fonts, and will render form elements as well.  If extended with images is selected, DSOrganize will render everything above as well as small images.
